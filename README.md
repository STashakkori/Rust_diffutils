# Rust_diffutils
Rust implementation of diff. Handles textual and binary data simplistically with room for improvement.

The plan is to keep working on this as a basis for Rust coreutils. Diff in my experience is one of the
most commonly and widely used tools in the stack. Hopefully this helps others as a basis to more. -ST
